# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts like custom functions and sub-procedures with parameters.
  2. Learn techniques for improving system maintainability and quality control.

## Instructions

So, you've completed the ["ActiveX Controls"](/exercises/activex-controls.md) exercise, and your original solution most likely contains duplicate code terms and expressions, especially around the OptionButton and Checkbox challenges (see "Original" code examples below).

Your mission for this new exercise is to **remove as much code duplication as possible** from the original exercise solution. (see "Simplified" code examples below).

If you have an existing workbook, copy and save a new version named something like "codebase-cleanup.xlsm", so you will be free to work on this new exercise without messing up the solution to the previous exercise. Otherwise, consider beginning fresh with this [starter workbook](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/codebase-cleanup-starter.xlsm).

## Example Solutions

> SPOILER ALERT: only view the "Simplified" code once you have analyzed the "Original" code and attempted to simplify it on your own.

  + OptionButton Solution: [Original](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/options-original.vb) --> [Simplified](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/options-simplified.vb)
  + Checkbox Solution: [Original](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-original.vb) --> [Simplified](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-simplified.vb) --> [Simplified Further](/exercises/codebase-cleanup/checks-simplified-further.vb) :smiley_cat:

## Further Exploration

Repeat the instructions, but this time refactor your ["Simple System"](/projects/simple-system.md) project deliverable instead.

How many lines of code did it start with? How many lines of code did it end with after the refactoring process? Use a line-counting tool [like this one](https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/count_lines/) to count the number of lines of code in your project before and after refactoring.

Optionally post your results to Slack (e.g. `Refactored my Simple System from X lines to Y lines! :raised_hands:`).
