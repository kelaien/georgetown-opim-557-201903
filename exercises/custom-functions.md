# "Custom Functions" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  1. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts like functions and parameters.

## Instructions

Create a new macro-enabled workbook called something like "custom-functions.xlsm".

On the first sheet, complete each of the following challenges, in order.

## Challenges

### Temperature Converter

Create a custom function to convert a Celsius temperature to a Fahrenheit temperature.

The user should be able to input a Celsius temperature (e.g. `0`) in a designated cell, then click a "Convert Temperature" button. The button, when clicked, should read the cell value, pass it into a custom function to get the return value (e.g. `32`), then write that value to a different cell.

### Gradebook

Create a custom function to convert a numeric grade score into a letter grade.

The user should be able to input a numeric grade score (e.g. `87.5`) in a designated cell, then click a "Calculate Letter Grade" button. The button, when clicked, should read the cell value, pass it into a custom function to get the return value (e.g. `"B+"`), then write that value to a different cell.
